# PSoC&trade; 6 MCU: WLAN manufacturing test application (Wifi-Mfg-Tester) for FreeRTOS

The Wifi-Mfg-Tester is used to validate the WLAN firmware and radio performance of Wi-Fi chips.

The Wifi-Mfg-Tester acts as a transport layer between the host "wl tool" and the WLAN firmware, and receives the commands from the wl tool and forwards them to the WLAN firmware using IOVAR/IOCTL commands. It also relays the response received back from the WLAN firmware.

The wl tool binaries for testing the WLAN firmware are also included in this application repository.

## Hardware setup

This application uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

The application running on a PSoC&trade; 6 MCU kit and the test setup are shown below:

![](images/mfg-test-setup.png)

**Note:** The [PSoC&trade; 6 Bluetooth&reg; LE pioneer kit (CY8CKIT-062-BLE)](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/cy8ckit-062-ble/) and the [PSoC&trade; 6 Wi-Fi Bluetooth&reg; pioneer kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT)](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/cy8ckit-062-wifi-bt/) ship with KitProg2 installed. ModusToolbox software requires KitProg3. Before using this application, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the Firmware Loader GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".


## Software setup

This application requires the WL tool running on a Windows PC and uses the UART port for communication with the target. The pre-built executables for the WL tool are available in the *wl-tool-bin/* directory.


## Using the application

### Building the app

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](http://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. Optionally, change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The following table lists the arguments for this tool:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional


The following example will clone the "[Wifi Mfg Tester](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-wifi-mfg-tester)" application with the desired name "MyWifiMfgTester" configured for the *CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT --app-id mtb-wifi-mfg-tester --user-app-name MyWifiMfgTester --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For more details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In third-party IDEs</b></summary>

Use one of the following options:

- **Use the standalone [Project Creator](http://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool:**

   1. Launch Project Creator from the Windows Start menu or from *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/project-creator.exe*.

   2. In the initial **Choose Board Support Package** screen, select the BSP and click **Next**.

   3. In the **Select Application** screen, select the appropriate IDE from the **Target IDE** drop-down menu.

   4. Click **Create** and follow the instructions printed in the bottom pane to import or open the exported project in the respective IDE.

- **Use command-line interface (CLI):**

1. Follow the instructions from the **In command-line interface (CLI)** section to create the application, and import the libraries using the `make getlibs` command.

2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

For a list of supported IDEs and more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

   ```
   cd wl-tool-bin/
   ```

2. Reset the board by pressing the SW1 button.

3. Run the command on Windows host for the WLAN chip on the target board:

   ```
   wl4343x.exe --serial <port> ver`
   ```

   For example:

   ```
   wl4343x.exe --serial 139 ver
   ```

4. Observe the output of the command.

		ioctl_echo
			check ioctl functionality

		up      reinitialize and mark adapter up (operational)

		down    reset and mark adapter down (disabled)

		out     mark adapter down but do not reset hardware(disabled)
				On dual-band cards, cards must be band-locked before use.

		clk     set board clock state. return error for set_clk attempt if the driver is not down
				0: clock off
				1: clock on

		restart Restart driver.  Driver must already be down.

		reboot  Reboot platform

   ```
**Note:** For targets based on [PSoCâ¢ 6 MCU with AIROCâ¢ CYW4343W Wi-Fi & BluetoothÂ® combo chip](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/wireless-connectivity/airoc-wi-fi-plus-bluetooth-combos/wi-fi-4-802.11n/cyw4343w/) and [PSoCâ¢ 6 MCU with AIROCâ¢ CYW43438 Wi-Fi & BluetoothÂ® combo chip](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/wireless-connectivity/airoc-wi-fi-plus-bluetooth-combos/wi-fi-4-802.11n/cyw43438/), use the WL tool: `wl4343X.exe`.
